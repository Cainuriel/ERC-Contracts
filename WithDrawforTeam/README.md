# Contract that prevents the withdrawal of funds if the team does not collect before
## To prevent rug the dev team for relying on getting paid after a presale or seed sale

### Payment is allowed by percentage of collection or a specific amount
### To consider:
#### The number of members of a team must be initialized in the deployment of the contract. Later it will not be possible to add more members or delete them.
